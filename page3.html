        </div>
            <p class="para3">You are proud as a master poet,
            <br>
                Poetic soul with rhythmical intellect,
            <br>
                Verse and prose comes from you imaginative wit,
            <br>
                Be laud with a prolific languages steal our spirit.
            <br>
            <br>
                One sadden moment I read your poetry,
            <br>
                Deep with significant messages, got pity with my vocabulary,
            <br>
                What a wonderful legendary poem story created beautifully.
            <br>
                Bravo, hooray! , , , it hooked my heart amazingly,
            <br>
            <br>
                A mail links popped-up on my search out of the blue,
            <br>
                Seeing with my two eyes rolling and open wide, no it can't be,
            <br>
                Copy paste poetry? ? ? Can't call it your own piece,
            <br>
                Not a genuine poet; with false charade and intelligence.
            <br>
            <br>
                Copy paste poetry lines from the internet search out,
            <br>
                Words are flowery so as lines are always with doubt,
            <br>
                Lies behind the copy paste poems, it gains distrust,
            <br>
                Craft your poem with honesty and integrity, please do my dear poet.
